# Rippling Developer Portal Example

This is a custom Django app to help Rippling partners understand how the Rippling API authorization flow works. This app is built specifically for our partners building App Shop listings in our Developer Portal. It demos the API token exchange and the demo app is currently hosted on Heroku.
